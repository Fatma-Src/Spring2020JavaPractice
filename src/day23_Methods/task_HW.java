public class task {
    /*
    write a methods that can return the maximum number between two numbers
			Ex: Max(10, 20) ==> 20
	2. write a method called Calculation, that passes 3 parameters: 2 numbers and one operator, and prints out the calculation
		if operator is not between [-, +, *, /, %] output should be Invalid Operator
		Ex: calculate(10, 2, '*') ==> 20;
			calculate(10, 2, '&') ==> Invalid operator
			NOTE: The method MUST take three arguments when it's called
	3. write a method that can identify if a string is palindrome
			ex: palindrom("level")  ==> true
				palindrome("Cybertek") ==> false

				1. write a method called KmToMiles that can convert km to miles
	 				1 km = 0.612 miles
	2. write a method called GalonsToLitters, that can convert gallons to litters
	 			   1 G = 3.75 L
	3. write a method called Calculation, that can accepts 3 parameters: 2 numbers and one operator, and prints out the calculation
		if operator is not between [-, +, *, /, %] output should be Invalid Operator
		Ex: calculate(10, 2, "*") ==> 20;
	4. write a method called Grade, that can print out the grade based on the score of the student
			if score is 100 ~ 90 ==> A
			if score is 89 ~ 80 ==> B
			if score is 79 ~ 70 ==> C
			if score is 69 ~ 60 ==> D
			if score is 0 ~ 59 ==> F
			otherwise ==> Invalid Score
		Ex:
			Grade(100); ==> A
			Grade(120); ==> Invalid
			4. creata a function that can print the maximum number from any given array
	5. creata a function that can print the minimum number from any given array
	6. create a function that can print out the array in descending order
		[1,2,3] == > [3,2,1]

		sk:
	1. write a method that can print all odd number between 1 ~ 100
	2. write a method that can print all even number between 1 ~ 100
